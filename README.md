Clean Sweep
   Purporse
Getting street sweeping tickets is no fun. In SF, it's a whole thing and I'm done with getting those tix. Clean Sweep helps me and you avoid getting them tickets.
   MVP
When you park, you hit the home screen bookmark to /park. The site will ask for geolocation data, and once retrieved, it will just have one button: "I'm parked here"
Based on the geolocation, I will query a database I've found at sfdata.org, and determine when the next st sweeping is.
User will be taken to /parked where he'll see the location, the next sweeping time, and how many hours/days it is away from now.
User will be taken to /parked where he'll see the location, the next sweeping time, and how many hours/days it is away from now.
A text message is also sent to the user, so he doesn't need to come to my site
The app will take into acct the location and the current time, and once it reaches a certain threshold, the user gets a text.
To tell us that he moved the car he user can come to the site and hit delete, or text back some pre-defined command
